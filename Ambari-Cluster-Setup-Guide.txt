=============================== STEP: 3 ====================================
to start the Ambari Server, type the below command at the command prompt
Command: ambari-server start

To check the status of the Amabari Server, type
Command: ambari-server status

To login into Admin console, open web broweser and access the URL: 
http://localhost:8080

user: admin
pass: admin

================================= Voila!!! ==================================



===================== To create a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) =================
change to root user
command: sudo su root
Then type in password

Then open the hosts file
command: vi /etc/hosts

Then add one line to the file having <the server id of the same server> <tab space> <hostname>
Note that you can check the hostname using command 'hostname'
If the hostnames are same for all the servers, you can permanently set the hostname using commands
Command: hostnamectl set-hostname <new Host Name>

e.g.of FQDN in a file can be: 
192.168.1.11	AMBARI_KAFKA_2


Note: To ping all servers based on FQDN, you need to map the FQDN of each server
to the /etc/hosts file of each server with the respective ip.

e.g. If there are 3 server, then each of the server's hosts file should have the 
below entries

192.168.1.11	AMBARI_KAFKA_2
192.168.1.8	AMBARI_KAFKA_1
192.168.1.4	AMBARI_SERVER
